Welcome to your first tutorial!

What are tutorials?
-------------------

In this course, tutorials are here to give you extra practice and review on the course content in a smaller class format, giving you more opportunities to have 
one-on-one support that you otherwise wouldn't be able to easily get in say a two hundred person lecture.

Do note that teaching assistants, or TAs, are given some freedom on how tutorials are run, so every tutorial will vary slightly in format and specific content, but all 
will cover the core concepts requied to be successful in this course.

Expectations when showing your work
-----------------------------------

This course isn't really proof and theory heavy, so when showing your work, you don't need to say stuff like "1 + 0 = 1 by the additive identity property of the real numbers", but you should justify
any steps that couldn't be easily followed by the TA (or sometimes professor) grading your paper (e.g. using L'Hopital's theorem, which you'll be doing later on in the course).

Sets
----

Let's start with a quick review of a concept you should be somewhat familiar with: Sets.

A set is a collection of distinct objects and is defined with curly braces :math:`\{ \}`, for example let :math:`S = \{3, 5, 6\}`.

You can use the symbol :math:`\in` to denote that an element belongs to a set (or in other words, the element is in a set). For example, :math:`3 \in \{1, 2, 3\}`.

Similarly, you can also say that :math:`4 \notin \{1, 2, 3\}`.

There's also the union (:math:`\cup`) and intersection (:math:`cap`) operators, for example :math:`\{1, 2, 3\} \cup \{8, 9\} = \{1, 2, 3, 8, 9\}`.

Notable sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might remember :math:`\mathbb{R}` from high school, which, lucky for you, is a set!

There's a few notable sets that will be helpful to know, those being:

- :math:`\mathbb{Z}` - The integers

- :math:`\mathbb{N}` - The natural numbers

- :math:`\mathbb{Q}` - The rational numbers (Any number that can be written as the ration of two integers)

- :math:`\mathbb{R}` - The real numbers (Basically any number)

Now here's a little trivia (well, basically the entirety of MATA22 if you decide to take that course)... what about :math:`\mathbb{R}^2`?

Intervals
~~~~~~~~~

Intervals can be expressed using either set-builder notation, that being something like :math:`I = \{x \in \mathbb{R} | 0 < x \le 3 \}` or in interval notation :math:`(0, 3]`

Quantifiers and shorthands
--------------------------

- :math:`\therefore` - Therefore

- :math:`\because` - Because

- st - Such that 

- :math:`\forall` - For all 

- :math:`\exists` - There exists

Try to translate the following between symbols and regular english:

- For all x in f(x), x = 5.

- Because y is in the set S, we have some integer k that is greater than y.

- For every rational number r, there is some integer k and some real number b such that r = k + b.
